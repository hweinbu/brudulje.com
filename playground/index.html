        <p>NARRATOR:</p>
        <p>According to all known laws
            of aviation,
             :
            there is no way a bee
            should be able to fly.</p>
        <p>Its wings are too small to get
            its fat little body off the ground.</p>
        <p>The bee, of course, flies anyway
             :
            because bees don't care
            what humans think is impossible.</p>
        <p>BARRY BENSON:
            (Barry is picking out a shirt)
            Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
            Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
             :
            Ooh, black and yellow!
            Let's shake it up a little.</p>
        <p>JANET BENSON:
            Barry! Breakfast is ready!
            BARRY:
            Coming!
             :
            Hang on a second.</p>
        <p>Barry uses his antenna like a phone</p>
        <p>- Barry?</p>
        <p>BARRY:
            - Adam?
            ADAM:
            - Can you believe this is happening?
            BARRY:
            - I can't. I'll pick you up.</p>
        <p>Barry flies down the stairs</p>
        <p>MARTIN BENSON:
            Looking sharp.</p>
        <p>JANET:
            Use the stairs. Your father
            paid good money for those.</p>
        <p>BARRY:
            Sorry. I'm excited.</p>
        <p>MARTIN:
            Here's the graduate.
            We're very proud of you, son.</p>
